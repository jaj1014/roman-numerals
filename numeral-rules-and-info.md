####Numeral Digits
I = 1

V = 5

X = 10

L = 50

C = 100

D = 500

M = 1000


####The key rules to remember are 
######(as found on http://able2know.org/topic/54469-1 ):

1. always express a number the simplest way possible - so long as it complies with the further rules:
2. digits 2, 3, 6, 7, 8 are always expressed as additive, digits 4 and 9 are always subtractive
3. subtractive rules:

I can only be subtracted from V or X,
V subtracts from nothing per rule 1, 
X can only be subtracted from L or C,
L subtracts from nothing - per rule 1,
C subtracts only from D or M,
D subtracts from nothing per rule 1 too!

4. A bar under a numeral multiplies it by 1000 (from about 1000 AD this rule was invented). I guess double bar multiplies by 1,000,000 
5. There is no zero (that was invented around 1500 AD - the romans were all gone by then Smile ) 
6. Larger numbers always come before smaller numbers, unless a valid subtractive rule (i.e. 4 or 9) are being applied 

####Examples
2 = II, 3 = III, 4 = IV, 5 = V, 6 = VI, 7 = VII, 8 = VIII, 9 = IX, 10 = X, 11 = XI, 12 = XII, 13 = XIII. 14 = XIV
15 = XV, 16 = XVI, 17 = XVII, 18 = XVIII, 19 = XIX, 20 = XX, 21 = XXI, 22 = XXII, 23 = XXIII, 24 = XXIV, 25 = XXV
26 = XXVI, 27 = XXVII, 28 = XXVIII, 29 = XXIX, 30 = XXX, 31 = XXXI, 32 = XXXII, 33 = XXXIII, 34 = XXXIV, 35 = XXXV
36 = XXXVI, 37 = XXXVII, 38 = XXXVIII, 39 = XXXIX, 40 = XL etc.
